This traditional style is characterized by a hearty and balanced malt profile and filled with notes of dark bread, toast and a kiss of toffee. Subtle hop bitterness balances the rich malts, and hints of roast and warmth are apparent. Lagered until beautifully round, this is a hearty beer for the late North Country fall."

This beer was made utilizing a multi-step mash and a single decoction in the sudhaus. Then fermented with our house lager yeast, naturally carbonated using a spunding technique, then lagered sideways for 3 months. The resulting beer is a complex yet beautiful malt forward lager beer, looking forward to the completion of hot summer days and transitioning to cooler, darker nights. Drink fresh or store it cold and drink them as the days go by."

The combination of malts delivers a rich flavour profile, with the taste-buds enlivened by a crispness in the finish, while the hop flavour bringing drinkability to this full bodied collaboration beer.

Therefore, in the era of admiration for hops, it is sometimes worth looking at beers that focus more on malts.We did it and we brewed our Koźlak, or Bock. An unique beer with a characteristic ruby ​​color and an essential caramel-hoppy flavor. The durable, fine-bubble head is light and only slightly tinged with the color of the beer. The aroma, of course, has hints of malty, reminiscent of dark bread. In addition, a delicate plum and raisins. Strong malt flavors are well-balanced with bitterness.The Polish name “koźlak” is a translation from German, where “bock” means a goat. The word “bock” itself comes from the Hanseatic city of Einbeck in northern Germany. This is where, since the 13th century, strong top-fermented beer has been brewed using wheat malt and barley malt. Almost every inhabitant of this city was involved (directly or indirectly) in brewing. Great importance was attached to the quality of the beer, so the beer was always tasted before being sold. The one that did not pass the “check” was simply poured out. Such good and even quality gained fame and popularity outside the country.We have been brewing Koźlak since 2003."

As solid as a rock, Andechser Doppelbock Dunkel presides over the evening meal with a colour reminiscent of dark copper with nuances of fiery red. Its clear gleaming look harmonises with its firm, fine pored head.Also the aroma delights the connoisseur: soft roasted accents and a nuance of dried fruit carrying a vein of caramel. This Doppelbock Dunkel from Bavaria’s Holy Mountain presents a pleasant effervescence. And then there’s the unmistakable flavour: mouthcoating and velvety, strong and yet pleasantly malty – a powerful, robust body. At the same time, it develops an easily recognisable sweetness, embraced in roasted cocoa and a light, bitter hoppiness.Concluding with a powerful punch, this Doppelbock departs with a lingering aftertaste of quality plain chocolate. A strong Doppelbock that embodies the centuries old Benedictine brewing tradition, sip by delicious sip."

It's easy to brew them too strong and too sweet.We enlisted our best Brooklyn brewery buds at Folksbier to pay homage to this under-represented style. Mellow, subtly wine-like, surprisingly fruit-forward, toasty and elegant, this beer is plain fun to drink. We're beyond thrilled with the outcome.Brewed with fine German Munich malt, German noble hops, and lagered for 8 weeks, these 12 oz. can cuties are pour brown with a reddish hue into your glass."

Paulaner monks in Germany brewed an especially delicious batch of beer with the intent to gain the Pope's approval for the brew as fit for the 40-day Lenten fast along with bread and water. But the beer was a little too good. Fearing that his Holiness would deem it sinfully indulgent, the monks sent it by ""slow donkey"" on the trip from Munich to Rome.By the time it arrived and the Pope tried the beer, it had spoiled and was deemed so vile as to be ""character building"" for any who could actually drink it. Doppelbock became an approved beverage for Lent, saved by one of the most humble creatures.To honor the slow but noble steed, we have given extended lagering time to our beer brewed with equal parts Pilsener, Vienna, and Munich malts, and lightly accented with noble hops. Smooth, sustaining, and delicious, pray that you always have another bottle on hand."

We then drop the temperature, freezing the water in the beer thus bringing the alcohol level up. The beer is transferred to a new tank so the ice can be extracted and the process is repeated. It is a lengthy process, 3 to 4 months, but in the end you have rich and smooth unfiltered beer with the ABV around 12.5% - 13.5%."

Limited quantities, you'll probably never see one from us again!"

Heller Bock Saphir,Brauerei Hofstetten / Krammer,Austria,Maibock,13,7.4,89,13414,3.96,45,36,7,4,"We dry-hopped this beer with full-cone saphire hops from the Mühlviertel to produce the fine, clean hop aromas of mild tropical fruits you’ll find in the glass.Behind the dry-hopping and new name lurks the ever-beloved Hofstetten Christmas Bock.Along with the heathy additions of Magnum, Aurora, and Select in the boil, this bock was also dry-hopped in our lager keller. This means we stuffed as many full-cone hops – fresh from the fields – as we could into a lager tank and filled the rest of the space with our bock beer. The beer was then left to mature for two months before it was once again enriched with hop oils.To preserve all the wonderful flavors developed during the process, this beer goes directly into bottles without filtration.Light-golden in color with a mild cloudiness, our Saphir-Bock shimmers tantalizingly in the glass. The floral hop aromas harmonize perfectly with the warm ester notes. When taken to the nose, you may make out hints of mandarin, lychee, and ripe pears. On the tongue, you'll immediately be struck by the full-bodiedness. As it moves back across the palate, the hop notes open up, revealing themselves in all their glory in the finish. The pleasant fruity-bitterness travels up the throat, across the palate, and into the nose, where it is greeted, once again, by the sweet ester notes of the yeast.This constant play between full-bodied maltiness and floral hoppiness ensures an unforgettable drinking experience."

The cask (called a firkin) in which we dry-hopped Dump Truck with Citra hops turned out to be one of the best. Summer 2015, Bayern had the opportunity to test drive a centrifuge (a.k.a. separator) allowing us to dry-hop a whole tank of Dump Truck and remove the hops."

Lenzbock is medium straw in color and has rich, nutty aromas complemented by floral, malty flavors and a slight bitter finish.

Brewed with 50% pale wheat malt, this beer exudes huge banana and clove aroma and flavor backed up by rich malt flavor, with a mild alcohol warmth in the finish. Well-known commercial examples include Aventinus and Vitus. Fans of authentic German-style wheat beers will love this. The clove and banana flavors derive from the classic Weihenstephan 380 Hefeweizen yeast and precision temperature control. The hopping of the beer is very low–most of the balance for the malt comes from the slight bitterness and drying that comes from the high alcohol content. With very few readily available commercial examples this a truly unique beer.22 IBU"

This beer originated in the Westphalia region of Germany in a town named Dusseldorf. Due to the cool climate of Dusseldorf, Altbiers employee an ale yeast that has evolved over time to ferment at somewhat cooler temperature than that of other ale yeasts. This cool fermentation produces subtle yeast derived esters and leaves a clean malty beer. In addition to this cool clean fermentation, altbiers are then lagered at cold temperatures to help smooth and refine the beer. The result of this is a very clean and hoppy red ale.Coming in at 6.2% ABV and IBUs Little Red Cap is an easy drinking hop forward beer worthy of its heritage. We use a bit of Cascade hop to give it an “American Twist” while maintaining its German heritage. This beer won a Gold Medal at the 2011 and 2016 GABF and a Bronze at the 2012 GABF. It also won a Silver Award at the 2016 World beer cup."

The predominant aromas are hazelnut and chocolate with hints of raisins and stone fruits but lacking the buttery smell or flavor of other dark ales. Flavors include toasted hazelnuts, raisins, caramel malt and mild green apples. No phenols (compounds responsible for a medicinal or smoky aroma and/or after-taste) are evident. The subdued, yet present hops create a light, crisp, refreshing taste. The finish is dry with mild caramel and green apples and a slight roastiness."

The branches add a cedar taste to the beer, while the needles add a subtle but present lemon peel aroma. We fermented with Espe Kviek yeast from Grodas, Norway. This unique strain produces delicious red fruit and dark fruit flavors to complement the chocolate maltiness of the base beer.

We mashed this more roast-driven traditional ale with a rich English malt base, complete with doses of caramel, brown and chocolate malts and a helping of English oats. The result is quite quaffable, and dangerously repeatable, with a nose lending of baked crusty breads, coffee bean, roasted nori and grilling spice."

Seconds,Grimm Artisanal Ales,"New York, United States",English Dark Mild Ale,10,3.0,88,13629,3.99,7,8,1,1,"Seconds is a richly flavored dark mild ale conceived as a nod to historical English brewing practices. This roasty, crisp, and refreshing quencher of a session ale updates the traditional practice of partigyle brewing. In the old days, English brewers would produce different “gyles” from the same mash: first (strongest) runnings would produce a highly intoxicating brew, and then 2nd and 3rd runnings would make more sessionable ones. In this way, they could produce several different worts from a single mash. These would often be blended to make ales of varying strengths. Seconds is brewed from the second runnings of a massive imperial stout. As is conventional for milds dating from the early to mid 20th century, it also incorporates a small amount of dark sugar. At 3%, this is the ideal convivial ale for maintaining the gentlest buzz as you savor the company of friends and family for hours on end."

The Mild greets your palate with a subtle interplay of nutty, roasty, and toffee malt character.

The Dubbel style beer originates from the Trappist abbey in Westmalle, where it is still brewed today. Dubbel (double) refers to the higher alcohol content, ours being at the modest end of the scale at 6.5% alc/vol. Our Dubbel has a deep brown-red colour. At once, this beer greets you with a sweet caramel aroma. The sweet berry, dark fruit, and slightly nutty flavours are well balanced with a subdued malt taste and a bit of sourness.Like our other beers the base for this brew is Pilsner malts. The colour and flavour profile comes mostly from the dark candi sugar which was caramelised right here in the brewery."

Trappist Dubbel,Brouwerij Westmalle,Belgium,Dubbel,3,7.0,93,3390,4.18,1316,1697,247,609,"Westmalle Dubbel (7%) is a dark red-brown beer with a rich, complex taste thanks to re-fermentation in the bottle. You pick up touches of caramel, malt and fruity esters reminiscent of ripe banana. The beer pearls beneath a covering of dense, cream-coloured froth. A lovely lace pattern forms on the inside of the glass once emptied. The long, dry finish of this balanced, mild Trappist beer will stay with you.Trappist or Dubbel?In 1865 the monks of Westmalle started brewing a dark Trappist beer in addition to their table beer. They adjusted the recipe in 1926, doubling the amounts of raw ingredients to produce a new, stronger beer. Dubbel is a logical name for this doubled beer, though it is more often simply called ‘Trappist’. To this day, the 1926 recipe is the basis for Westmalle Dubbel.Westmalle Dubbel: bottle and tapWe are all familiar with Westmalle Dubbel in 33 cl bottles. But around 150 carefully selected Belgian cafés and restaurants serve this beer on tap from barrels containing 20, 30 and 50 litres. In the barrel, this living beer evolves differently to emerge with a slightly sweeter taste.Westmalle Dubbel can also be purchased in 75 cl bottles. The beer matures in a different way in a larger bottle to produce a noticeably milder finish."

In his spare time, Brother Joseph used found objects such as marbles and chunks of concrete and tile to build miniature shrines and buildings on the Abbey grounds. Over 40 years, he created 125 different models and replicas. Today, the Ave Maria Grotto covers three acres and is world-renowned as both a fun roadside attraction and an awe-inspiring collection of folk art. We have named our Belgian dubbel after Brother Joseph as a testament to his perseverance, his hard work, and his indomitable spirit. A full-flavored abbey-style ale with a complex taste and aroma, Brother Joseph’s Dubbel is filled with specialty malt and dark fruit character."

This beer creates an endless variety of sensations with a lingering taste and powerful aroma.

Bavarian noble hops balance the beer with a mild bitterness and soft floral aroma. The result is a full-bodied dark copper colored ale with a smooth texture and spicy-like characteristic from the rye malt.

A eureka moment; the flavours imparted by Single Malt Whisky casks on this beer gave us a whole new way in brewing and with that Innis & Gunn was born.We brew a beautiful honey-hued, malty, golden Scottish beer. We then carefully mature it using hand selected single malt whisky casks; the best we can source. This maturation lends the beer an incredible smoothness and depth of flavour with hints of vanilla, toffee, and oak.The result is a truly unique, delicious beer brimming with vanilla and toffee. That richness is perfectly balanced by notes of orange marmalade, citrus, and hints of oak with a very gentle understated bitterness. A delicate, velvety mouthfeel completes the experience. Smooth, refreshing, and decidedly different from the usual.Now in new packaging, The Original is still the great tasting, award-winning beer it always has been. One that continues to define our spirit of Originality.The Original uses an expertly balanced combination of three malts; Innis & Gunn Ale Malt, Crystal Malt and Amber Malt. This exquisitely judged combination earned The Original a Grand Gold certification at the 2021 Monde Selection."

Well, I guess Yukoners have been doing it for many years before we showed up, but this Olde English Ale has to make the whole thing a little more bearable.This brew is not for the faint of heart; it doesn’t leap out and bite you (most Lead Dogs are better trained than that), but it will most certainly sneak up and knock you for a loop if given the chance (this character might be more comparable to that of the Malamute and Husky!).Brewed to be high test, 7% alcohol by volume, the beer nonetheless drinks very smooth; the product of a careful blend of six different malts, and 2 months of aging after fermentation. The dark chocolate appearance is reminiscent of a porter, and the slightly darkened creamy head tops the look. But the first sip lets you know that this beer can be consumed, in quantity if desired (or required?), without leading to an overly full gullet.Intricate malt flavours predominate, with a medium mouth-feel and a very light bitter. This ale promises to take the chill off after running the team in the crisp January nights."

Originating from Vienna in the mid 1800’s, amber lagers were derived when new kilning methods created malts that were light in color, contributing to a rich amber color. European immigrants brewed amber lagers in America which were slightly lighter and less malty than their European cousins. Although extremely popular prior to prohibition, amber lagers all but disappeared afterwards. We are proud to resurrect this wonderful pre-prohibition style Amber Lager.The beer label a painting of the Tennessee State Capitol Building, which was built in 1859 - the same year as the Nashville Brewing Company."

A lager yeast fermentation gives Colorado Native a slight fruitiness, complementing a citrus aroma note from a late kettle hop addition. Everything then comes together to deliver a clean taste and dry finish that is very drinkable by itself, or paired with your favorite foods."

It is unfiltered and lagered for well over three months to give the beer time to naturally clear. The color is a dark orange/amber and the aroma is of fresh malt with hints of caramel.

Dry-hopped with an abundance of Chinook, Cascade, and Mosaic hops, Kin Kin Red features tantalizing notes of pine, grapefruit, muddled blueberries and orange rind. A bitter malt backbone adds a welcome level of balance, while its natural carbonation and extended lagering time helped fashion a clean finish. The desire to brew Kin Kin Red stemmed from memories of the progenitors of the craft beer movement when beers like Boston Lager, Brooklyn Lager, and other amber lager beers excited the palates of many. Obviously, given our penchant for Big C hop flavour and bitterness, we gave this lager a deliciously old school west-coast bend."

Lager beer in the “Vienna” style was one of the local favorites. Brooklyn Lager is amber-gold in color and displays a firm malt center supported by a refreshing bitterness and floral hop aroma. Caramel malts show in the finish. The aromatic qualities of the beer are enhanced by “dry-hopping”, the centuries-old practice of steeping the beer with fresh hops as it undergoes a long, cold maturation. The result is a wonderfully flavorful beer, smooth, refreshing and very versatile with food. Dry-hopping is largely a British technique, which we’ve used in a Viennese-style beer to create an American original."

We get notes of honey wheat bread crust, corn pops cereal, rye toast, a touch of caramel, and mildly spicy / floral hops."

Known as Tmavé Pivo, this beer showcases roasty malt complexity in a way that's creamy, highly drinkable and low ABV. This release completes our Czech lager trifecta (Yore and Lifeworld round out the trio).Where Volition (our German style Black Lager) is dry and drinkable with slight dark German pretzel roast notes, Indelible leans towards rich chocolate, bearing full flavor, creamy, smooth texture and finishing at just 4.4%. If you enjoyed Precipice, our collaboration with Schilling Beer Co., you should definitely pick this one up.As with Yore and Lifeworld, Indelible is brewed with 100% Czech ingredients and is largely differentiated from the German lagers in our lineup by the Czech lager yeast used in fermentation (German yeast results in drier, crisper beers; Czech yeast, richer and fuller ones)."

Through extended, natural conditioning, not a hint of haze remains. An aggressive pour yields a thick and billowing head that clings to the side of the glass as you work your way through the pour. It is the most appealing looking beer we have made in recent memory. We taste mild chocolate, brown bread, hay, and earthy noble hops. It goes down remarkably easy while leaving a pleasant and lingering impression on your palate. The mark of a great beer is the ease in which it drinks in conjunction with potent, appealing, and incisive flavors. To that end, we are extraordinarily proud to offer Nomad to you for your enjoyment. I’m not sure if there is another beer we will collectively drink more of this autumn at Tree House."

Our inspiration from the experiences had there have been expressed most recently through Poetica and Memoria. One of my fondest memories was the discovery of true Czech dark lager (tmavé pivo). A perfect synthesis of slight roast, creamy carbonation, hinted-at hops—and immense satisfaction.So, in October of 2018, Shaun brewed our first single-decocted dark lager and conditioned it at 3º Celsius—as we have with Poetica and Memoria—in one of our French oak puncheons for more than 3 months. The beer was then moved to stainless steel and krausened with fresh-fermenting lager to provide slow, gentle, natural carbonation. This Wednesday, 20 February, we proudly pour for you Rhetorica. Like Poetica and Memoria, Rhetorica furthers our exploration of wood-conditioned lagers, typifying our commitment to respectful yet forward-thinking refinement of classical brewing styles—a quiet veneration of the past that guides a progressive aspiration towards the future. Rhetorica instantly transports me back to a warm spring day spent overlooking the Vltava and the spires of Praha from Letná Park while savoring a classic tmavé pivo—a gift, indeed.Soft. Sincere. Simple."

Warm, full-bodied, and richly malted with inviting aromas of fresh baked cookies, raisin bread, and just a hint of dark fudge followed by a spicy, earthy note from traditional noble hopping to dry the palate and ready you for the next sip. We kept going back to lengthy walks in Old Town/Stare Mesto in Prague. Cobblestone clicking of shoes, quiet echoes off low walls, and old lanterns. Zigzag streets with tight corners; maze-like. Cold, but soft and romantic. Medieval and magical and so steeped in history that it is indifferent to you and the fleeting present. Perhaps the quietness is the most striking and somehow this leads one almost inextricably into the welcome embrace of one of the many Czech pubs. Most of which in Prague are found in the lower levels and basements of age-old buildings. Some flood happened hundreds of years ago and that’s just how they are. So you walk off the street down a flight or three with twists to a cavernous dwelling thick with cigarette smoke, joyous conversation, and fast poured 0.5Ls being whisked double-handfuls to wooden tables. Nowadays, the cigarette smoke is no longer a thing, but the sense of coziness and ample stocks of rich lager remain. Czech currency is “Koruna” or “Crown” in English and beers cost 19-35 Czk. 10, 20, and 50 pieces are the best to carry and there’s no better feeling than putting down a few coins for a pivo and losing oneself in this charming din searching for the bottom of your Tübinger of Tmavý lager."

Flavor-wise, the distinction is moot, as it bears elements of both camps; rich sweetness from a small amount of caramelized rye, toasted biscuits from the Maillard products that show up in the base malt, a calming softness from the lager yeast. Altogether, it's a reflection of both complexity, and ultimate simplicity - a direct hit to the mug, if you will. Both perfect for necking down, and patient sipping, it'll find a place in your heart one way or another. Brewed in collaboration with UnHitched Brewing."

The most famous of these is U Fleku, a brewpub in continuous operation since 1499 (thatʼs right, over 500 years of brewing in the same spot). They brew but one beer, a delicious, bready dark beer that starts out at 13ºP. In describing good beer, the Czechs use the expression chlebnatost,meaning “full-breadedness”. It is the perfect description of this toasty, malt-centric lager brewed with Bohemian Floor-malted Pilsner malt and just a hint of spicy CzechSaaz hops."

Although dark in color, 1554 is not a porter, stout, schwarzbier or bock. Rather, it is a rebirth of a lost beer style called zwert (Flemish for black), which uses gruit for bittering. The oldest reference to zwert beer comes from 1285. However, our brewing inspiration came from a book published in 1554, which was the height of popularity for zwertbeer. First released in 1998, our whimsical improvisation includes a variety of specialty dark malts, a dash of licorice root, and a European lager yeast that's fermented at ale temperatures.21 IBU"

A few of us had just returned from a short trip to Prague and settled on brewing an often overlooked Czech style —Tmavé Pivo (dark beer in Czech). The resultant beer resonated with both teams, and I knew it was a style I wanted to repeat on our home system. For this iteration, we beefed up the ABV and malt profile as an homage to a now defunct Czech brewery that produced a legendary dark lager in the outskirts of the Bohemian Forest. This beer is the perfect fusion of creamy carbonation, slight roast, and a trace of classic noble hops. It takes me back to a cold afternoon drinking dark lagers in Letná Park while overlooking the city of Prague. Simple times drinking simple beer—in my opinion the epitome of lager beer culture. –Tom"

Dunkel is made from amber colored Munich malt. Germans approach dark beer from a different direction than their Belgian and British neighbors. Instead of using a small amount of high-color, dark-roasted or caramelized malt, Germans use a lot of low or medium color malt that avoids the acrid bitter roastiness or burnt sugar flavors found in stouts and porters. Dunkel is a medium -bodied beer with a slightly sweet, toasted bread crust malt flavor and smooth finish accentuated with just enough noble bitterness to balance the malt.18 IBU"

The barley was grown Screamin Hill Brewery and malted Rabbit Hill Malthouse and the heirloom corn was grown a few miles away on our farmland. This seasonal German lager was hopped for balance in the kettle with Hallertau Mittelfrüh, fermented cool, then spent an additional 8 weeks cold conditioning in one of our dedicated lagering tanks.The result is a super smooth, lighter bodied brew featuring rich, toasty, nutty, malty aromas and flavors followed by a balanced, dry finish. We get notes of rich, toasty bread, hazelnuts, caramel, a touch of cocoa, sweet heirloom corn, and a hint of herbal/ floral noble hops."

The hard water found in the region played a special role in producing this specialty. In his book “Beer International”, the world-renowned English beer writer, Michael Jackson, accurately describes the Ayinger “Altbairisch Dunkel” as: “A good example of its kind. Impenetrably dark with a golden-brown gleam when held up to the light, and with a warm aroma and malty taste, while summoning up coffee taste sensations on going down. It is brewed from five types of malt (two of which are torrified dark), and it is only lightly hopped.” It is produced using the traditional double fermentation process."

Además, a nuestro ya clásico lúpulo gallego, sumamos el uso cebada cultivada en las tierras de Sober (Galicia). De color caoba y visualmente limpia, en nariz destacan los aromas tostados aportados por las maltas, que nos trasladan al mundo del caramelo y los frutos secos. En un segundo nivel surgen los matices florales y especiados procedentes del lúpulo. También están presentes suaves notas alcohólicas. Una entrada en boca dulce y maltosa da paso a un gusto amargo, con un moderado perfil resinoso. Sabrosa, sedosa, con cuerpo y calidez media, el postgusto es prolongado, amargo y con suaves notas picantes.You have a warmer lager in your glass than in previous editions. In addition, to our already classic Galician hops, we add the use of barley grown in the fields of Sober (Galicia). Mahogany and visually clean, the toasted aromas provided by the malts taking us to the world of caramel and nuts. On a second level, the floral and spicy nuances from the hops emerge. Soft alcoholic notes are also present. A sweet and malty entry on the palate gives way to a bitter taste, with a moderate resinous profile. Tasty, silky, with medium body and warmth, the aftertaste is long, bitter and with mild spicy notes."

Made with German pilsner, teetered up with some toasted Munich Malt, and a dab of roasted malt for color. We hopped gently with German-born Hallertau and Saaz hops before spunding fermentation for natural carbonation and aging many weeks in our horizontal lagering tanks.

The classic Hallertau Mittelfruh hops provide balance, but largely stay in the background.

Inspired by the dynamic New England climate, we recalibrate and evolve our recipe annually to produce a new iteration each Fall. The 2021 version has us taking inspiration from Bavaria, as we brew our take on a Munich Dunkel Lager.Pouring a gorgeous ruby brown color with crimson highlights, and just a touch of haze, the nose is as complex as it is inviting. Malt-forward aromas of graham cracker, bread crust, molasses, and toffee waft from the glass. With each sip, we tease out secondary notes of lightly toasted nuts, dried fruit, black tea, and a touch of autumn spice. Light- to medium-bodied and infinitely drinkable, Deciduous 2021 is the beer we'll be enjoying by the bonfire, on the trails, and at our tables, all fall long.Malt - Pilsner, Munich 10L, Caramunich IIHops - Hallertauer"

This is the beer that made Munich famous. The challenge is getting the color right without using too much black malt, as this beer shouldnâ€™t display that character. We use 90% Munich Malt in the grist, along with a small amount of Amber and Caramel Malt and less than 1% Carafa (a German Black Malt). The beer is dark brown/red in color, with both malt and subtle hop aromas. The beer shows strong and complex malt character, with a hint of milk chocolate. The hops take a back seat to the malt, and only keep things in balance.1.015 BG, 24 IBU, 17 SRM"

Aecht Schlenkerla Kräusen,Brauerei Heller-Trum / Schlenkerla,Germany,Rauchbier,27,4.55,89,11640,4.0,36,27,13,0,"Also known as Helles Märzen Kräusen Blend.In the world of German brewing, Kräusen refers to the intense proliferation of bubbles and foam formed during fermentation of a young or “green” beer. And Aufkräusen (literally to kräusen it up), refers to a historic brewing technique in which some green beer is added to a fully-matured lager. This is a very old and very typically German tradition, and today even English-speaking brewers refer to this technique as krausening. Krausening brings the vibrant freshness of young beer to the more refined, austere flavors of a fully-matured lager.Aecht Schlenkerla Kräusen starts out as normal Helles Schlenkerla Lager and matures for months in the old rock cellars underneath the brewery. Just before filling it is blended using the before mentioned ""Kräusen"" technique with classic Märzen Rauchbier. The result is an unfiltered, bottom fermented and amber color Märzen Lager hybrid with a vibrant and slightly smoky flavor.IBU: 30"

The resulting Schlenkerla Oak Smokemalt has a smoother and more multilayered smoky note than the intensely aromatic beech smokemalt. The hence complex smokiness in this double bock is paired with the multifaceted bitterness of finest Hallertau aroma hops. With 8% alcohol and amber color it matures for months in the 14th century brewery cellars into a special treat for smoke beer lovers. As one of the last traditionally made smoked beers, Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier is a passenger in the „Ark of Taste” by SlowFood®.Brewed with 100% Schlenkerla Oak Smoke Malt40 IBU from finest aroma hopsBernstein (amber) color"
Buchenrauch,Wolf's Ridge Brewing,"Ohio, United States",Rauchbier,29,5.7,89,12026,3.99,33,41,1,5,"2020 Bronze Medal winner at The Great American Beer FestivalThe traditional Rauchbier lager style hails from Bamberg Germany. The name Buchenrauch literally means ""beech smoke,"" which pays homage to the time honored tradition of smoking the malt over beech wood to create the signature smooth smokiness. Mahogany in color and rich in flavors of campfire smoke and crusty bread. Buchenrauch is crisp and savory. The lager yeast and cold aging provide smooth drinkability, yielding a beer perfectly suited for pairing with grilled meats, assertive cheeses, and the great outdoors."

""The smoked malt gives this beer a distinct mesquite bbq flavor, but finishes crisp and refreshing,"" notes Taylor.

""I've been enjoying Tonewood's lagers like Pool Boy and Lumber Yard, so they were a natural choice for this collaboration,"" says Tom Peters. ""We hopped it a little more aggressively than they have hopped their lagers or pilsners (9 lbs vs. 11 lbs for MC Lager.) I had our own crew participate: we tasted a few Tonewood beers and found out how much hops they usually add to the boil for each. MC Lager has a fair amount of Saaz and Hallertau hops in it, but all low alpha acid, so you are going to get a lot of wonderful aroma and dryness but very little bitterness."""

Decoction mashing with 100% imported Munich and Pilsner malt in addition to de-husked roasted barley malt produces rich malt flavors of roasted coffee and chocolate, while 100% imported Perle hops from Seitz Farm in Bavaria’s famous hop-growing Hallertau Valley impart moderate bitterness to balance the rich malt character. Weeks of cold lagering with pure Bavarian lager yeast from Andechs, a German monastery brewery, creates a crisp, clean finish. This bier is naturally carbonated by CO2 produced during fermentation and conditioning.25 IBU"

We've all been there. But now we're here.Behold: Schwarzbier, the blackest of lagers. This is the one you pull out when you have a fucking point to make about the diversity of lagers. Magnetron is malty, medium-bodied, and gently hopped. The magic of lagering makes this brew rich, but mild and well-balanced. Expect flavors of bittersweet chocolate and coffee, and a crisp, dry finish.Darker than Satan's soul. As metal as Dave Lombardo's double-kick. None more black."

NOPE! “Unknown Beast” is everyone’s favorite style: German Schwarzbier! Oh, heeeeyyy!We started things off with a base of Riverbend Pilsner, gently layered in some Munich, Toasted Oats, Roasted Wheat, and a few other lil’ Specialty secrets before hopping it with Hallertauer Mittelfruh throughout the boil and smashing it full of Northern Brewer in the Whirlpool. We implemented our traditional German Lager treatment otherwise: slow and cold fermentation, spunding for 100% natural carbonation, and a long rest in a Horizontal Lagering Tank.It starts off with notes of roasty Cacao, sweet Hazelnut, toasted Wheat bread, and just a hint of dem beans. Got me thinkin’ ‘bout dem beans...uh, right...then this finishes with the extra clean, crisp, and dry character we strive for. Don’t let the appearance of this beast fool you, it’s easily one of our favorite Lager offerings to date, and maintains that high level of crushability you’ve come to expect from our Chippy Boi™ Lager Program."

Sessions Black Lager Schwarzbier,The Schlafly Tap Room,"Missouri, United States",Schwarzbier,101,5.0,83,25870,3.64,42,68,5,5,"Sessions Black Lager is a traditional German Schwarzbier with a refreshingly light body. The dark chocolate malts contribute color and hints of roasted coffee balanced by the delicate aroma of German Noble hops. Translated from German, Schwarzbier means black beer.﻿Schwarzbier originated in the 16th Century in southeastern Germany where it is still brewed today. The style enjoyed a heyday in St. Louis in the late 1800s, but large scale production of dark lagers failed to resurface after Prohibition. In 2007, the beer community of St. Louis honored St. Louis Dark Lager as the official beer of the inaugural St. Louis Brewers Heritage Festival, an annual tasting event that celebrates the many breweries thriving in St. Louis today.﻿45 IBU"

Brewers’ Reserve: California Common,Perennial Artisan Ales,"Missouri, United States",California Common / Steam Beer,Not Given,6.0,Not Given,Not Given,0.0,0,0,0,0,Brewer Dave has concocted a knockout classic for the first rendition of our beloved Brewers’ Reserve series. California Common is a classic American brew. This amber colored beer was created to use lager yeasts in early western towns that didn't have the ability to cool wort to lagering temperatures. Fermenting the beer at ale temperatures allows a mild fruity ester to appear on the nose. The flavor balances the toasty caramel/toffee malt sweetness with a hit of floral hop bitterness before finishing slightly dry and crisp.

A classic American style, the California Common, also called ""steam beer"", strikes the perfect balance of flavor. Beautiful hop presence supported by a great malt character make this one pop on the palate. Brewed with lager yeast but treated like an ale yeast (fermented at higher temps) resulted in a brew that's chock full of character, beautiful floral and fruity esters complimented by an addition of Mandarina Bavaria hops. Subtle dark berry on the nose and candied orange on the palate. We can also see this one pairing super well with rich, grilled meat and funky cheeses."

The beer is then conditioned with shredded coconut post-fermentation. “Tastes like vacation”. “Official beer of the Swedish Bikini Team”. “Pina colada beer”. These are some of the comments we have gotten from customers and staff. The interplay between the tropical hops and creamy coconut is divine. ""vacation in a bottle"" pretty much sums up this beer."

At the beginning of run off, we add a portion of hops to the sweet wort in the kettle; a technique known as ""first wort hopping"". As the boil begins, a generous amount of Chinook hops are added for bittering. Later, in the whirlpool, the beer is hopped with a blend of Centennial and Amarillo, for aroma. This same blend is used, post fermentation, to lend additional hop character to the finished beer. The result is a complex brew with a malty palate, intense hop aromas, pronounced bitterness and a pleasantly dry finish."

A significant portion of our grain bill includes malted wheat to produce a medium body while finishing with a low bitterness on the palate. The combination of Mosaic, Ekuanot, and Ariana hops produce a supernova of tropical fruit and berry aromas and flavors, with undertones of vanilla and pine. Galactic Haze is fermented with a Belgian yeast strain at warm temperatures to encourage ester production and their complementary juicy fruit character."

So while many thought it was an April Fool's joke when we announced Rouge, a Brut IPA blended with Pinot Noir juice and dedicated to typos, we knew it was real and it was spectacular. The label is an anagram of our name: Rogue. And it's been the most common misspelling of our brand since day one.We can't count the times we've received phone calls for a ""Rouge Alés"" and we relish the opportunity to recount that one time our brewer's yeast was accidentally delivered to the gentleman's lounge, Club Rouge in Portland instead of Rogue Eastside Pub & Pilot Brewery. Heck, we've even been guilty of misspelling our own name once or twice. It's such a common gaffe, we've even given it a term: ""getting rouged.""After 30 years of ""getting Rouged,"" we felt it was time to embrace our rougey roots and brew something delicious in honor of it.Rogue Innovation Brewer Michael King started with a brut IPA, a dry but aromatic example of the IPA style, combining 2-Row Malt, Corn Flakes and Rolled Oats. For hops, he selected Mosaic, Chinook, El Dorado, Strata, Rogue Farms Alluvial. He of course used our proprietary Pacman Yeast and Newport's own Free Range Coastal Water. And for a real Rogue (Rouge?) twist on it all, he blended it with Oregon Pinot Noir juice.The result is a crisp and semi-dry brut IPA co-fermented with Oregon Pinot Noir juice for a unique flavor and an added rouge hue. The finish is hoppy and delicious."

It’s a higher alcohol IPA with a pleasing light amber color and bursting with classic IPA bitterness and hop character we know you love.Wharf Rat is an homage to the neighborhood of Belleville that ran along what is now St. Paul Street, but what used to be Wharf Street during the 1900’s. This area, which lay between the tracks and the wharves was an industrial neighborhood of foundries, rolling mills, coal yards, oil tanks, trains and docks. It was an interesting mix of factory workers, families, colourful characters and prohibition rum runners. If you want to know more about this time in Belleville’s history the city has memorialized the Wharf Rat citizens with a plaque located on the back of the Jane Foster Park sign.90 IBU"

Black Tie Required is big on raspberries and strawberry flavor from the large dose of fruit and accentuated by strawberry, citrus character of the Belma hop, but drinks dry and slightly tart from the low final gravity and acidity of the fruit."

Before they started to vanish about twenty years ago, puffed rice vendors had taken every neighborhood’s street corners. They put rice into a high pressure cooker, and rotated the cooker over a charcoal stove. When inside temperature and pressure reached their targets, they released the cookers’ valve with an iron level wrench. With a big ‘bang!’, all the rice will burst out of the cooker and get puffed instantly when they hit the cold air. It’s amazing for children to watch a cup of 3oz rice turned into a big load of happiness.When it comes to brewing , the whole grain puffed rice provides a cleaner and crispier body than gelatinized rice starch, and significantly more concentrated rice flavors. As a result Master Gao’s Puffed Rice Chinese Pale Ale has notes of sake & malt balanced with tropical hops and a very dry finish. A most remarkable combination of sake, saison and champagne."

IPA,Harpoon Brewery & Beer Hall,"Massachusetts, United States",English IPA,64,5.9,82,26731,3.62,1315,3032,100,1011,"We started brewing this beer as a summer seasonal in 1993. There were some great IPAs out in the Pacific Northwest, but no local IPAs on the east coast. We wanted to have a local IPA, so we brewed one. People absolutely loved it, and so did we. So we made it a year-round beer, and it’s now our bestselling beer and our flagship.Since its introduction, Harpoon IPA has remained unique in its ability to balance hop bitterness with a strong malt backbone. Dry-hopped with Cascade hops, it has a floral hop aroma and a finish that is bitter (it is an IPA after all!) without being harsh or astringent. Combined with a malty sweetness and the fruity esters of our proprietary yeast, those hops create a beer that is wonderfully hoppy but clean and refreshing enough to enjoy a few of - and we hope you do.42 IBU"

These types of beers were quite a 'late' invention in Scotland where they have been making all types of beers, some of the hoppiest you've ever seen, for hundreds of years; which is the case here. Edinburgh, 1866. Bleak. Sooty. Dreary. Hoppy? This bright, wee Scottish IPA was crafted to be drunk in quantity. Spicy resins, apricots, tangerine zest and loads of honied graham cracker. Traditional malts meet citrus and spice, with a ripping hop-heavy finish. Something hoppingly different for you IPA fans out there!"

We pair floor malted Maris Otter malt with a lavish quantity of East Kent Goldings hops and ferment and condition under pressure for several weeks. The result is a refreshing beer with remarkable depth. Aging this beer will bring out the treacle and marmalade notes while the strong herbaceous bitterness will fade slightly to a gentle tea-like note.Appearance: Pale gold color with frothy white head. Aroma: Strong herbaceous nose with hints of orange rind, bread, and marmalade. Body: A medium rich malt body with clean herbal bitterness. Texture: Smooth malt and citrus notes. Finish: Lingering malt taste with honey and marmalade notes."

This IPA got tired of being ""West Coast"" and being ""Hazy"" so this IPA asked his higher power to make him something new or better. Big Sky Daddy responded and made this better version of the IPA and the ""Cold IPA"" was born. Starring six amazing hop varieties, adding rice to the grain bill, and getting carbonated the old fashioned way through krausening is what makes this style different. So, come on over to the cold side with the new Big Sky Daddy."

Magnum, Cascade, Liberty, and Saaz hops lend our IPA a citrus aroma, with a touch of noble hop distinction and herbal complexity, and a smooth, clean bitterness. The use of five different malts in our grain bill provides Wildcat with the complex flavors of malty sweetness, bread, and caramel that we use to round out our brew. Just like the settlers of Wildcat Mountain who inspired its name, Wildcat IPA blazes its own path into history. We hope you’ll be inspired to go your own way too, as you enjoy our Wildcat IPA."

Originally, IPA was brewed to send to English troops stationed in India (that’s the “India” in India Pale Ale).Pretty much the opposite of modern IPAs that have a shelf life of a few weeks, the original version was aged a year or more before drinking. Brutally bitter when young (160 IBUs) the long aging softened the bitterness and also gave some funk from the Brettanomyces in the barrels.Our version was brewed with 100% Maris Otter malt and 100% East Kent Goldings hops. Aged in neutral oak barrels with Brett for 8 months. Could easily be cellared for another year or two but is fabulous right now.Beautiful funk in the aroma battles it out with marmalade notes from the dry hops. Drinkable with a crisp bitterness that isn’t harsh at all."

They're hazy, slightly sweet, and hoppy, with a velvety mouthfeel unlike any other. Some people love them, some people consider them blasphemy – luckily they're an optional spice of life (that sell out faster than we can brew them). Plan for these awful, no good, sacrilegious beers accordingly.We love all our beers equally and would never play favourites, but if we had to live out the remainder of our days on a desert island, let's just say this juicy, spritzy, citrus bomb disguised as a beer, would be on our short list. It's kind of like if freshly squeezed OJ and a creamsicle had a baby, and then that baby went on to become an overachiever you wanted to hate but just couldn't."

After fermentation, Creamsicle Ice Cream Milkshake IPA was conditioned on vanilla soft serve ice cream, orange sorbet, and Madagascar vanilla.The result is a medium-full bodied IPA that drinks like a melting cone of vanilla-orange sorbet “swirl” soft serve ice cream cone melting on a hot summer day.We get notes of bright, citrusy orange sorbet, rich, creamy vanilla soft serve ice cream, sweet clementine, vanilla bean, and fruity hops."

It is well rounded with a grainy-sweet malt character, earthy, spicy hop nose and just the right amount of orange spice flavor throughout each drink."

Hill 70,4 Degrees Brewing Company,"Ontario, Canada",Belgian Blonde Ale,Not Given,7.0,Not Given,Not Given,3.62,0,2,0,0,"On August 15, 1917, the Canadian attack to capture Hill 70 opened with a massive artillery barrage. German troops counter-attacked no less than 21 times over ten days. Each time they met a wall of Canadian bullets and shells. The Germans did not abandon the ruins of Lens, France. Canadian efforts kept large German forces pinned down in defence of the town of Lens. When the major fighting came to an end around August 15, 1917 Canadian losses numbered 10,000 men but the Germans were dislodged and the city of Lens was in Allied hands. Unfortunately, the Battle of Hill 70 is one of Canada’s forgotten battles. Our Hill 70 beer is dry and crisp with notes of apple, pears, banana, cloves and spice. A complex fruity background with a clean finish."

It’s crackery and ever-so-lightly toasty. The Belgian Abbey yeast strain does all the work here, giving an array of honey, pear and white pepper aromas, with just the lightest juicy fruit aromas and flavours. It finishes mostly dry, with a lingering, rounded sweetness.Deceptively simple. Wonderfully delicious. Take time to enjoy the Golden Hour.Cheers!"

Crisp, complex, and refreshing, the result is a classically Belgian balance of fruity esters, rustic grist character, and a zesty hop finish."

Devotion,The Lost Abbey,"California, United States",Belgian Blonde Ale,18,6.0,87,17820,3.87,360,604,60,142,"Belgian Style dry hopped Blonde Ale. It’s an unassuming road leading to the priory. Here, off the corner of two intersecting roads, dedicated monks have been making beer for over 150 years. It’s always been a simple life — the kind that requires they brew only enough to sustain the activities of their monastery. In the silence of passing seasons, they pray, they brew and retire in solitary existence behind the sheltering walls. They live a most interesting life. Most likely one we couldn't sustain.Nearby, each summer, the trellised fields spring to life as rows of resinous green cones are trained toward the heavens. Rumor is some monks love these hops and being surrounded by budding yellow aromas and the leafy pungent fields inspired them. Since we aren't sensible enough to locate our brewery near hop fields, we can only offer this blond ale in celebration of our Abbey brethren and their steadfast Devotion."

We continue to marvel at the complexity of Belgian Trappist beer, and take a great deal of inspiration from them as yeast and fermentation driven brewers focused on bottle conditioned products. For us, there's almost nothing better than an Orval. I'll save you the longform TED Talk on the Trappist monks who brew the beer and what monastic life in their Abbey looks like, and just say Orval is a real treasure and pleasure to drink. This beer, Oaxen, is our love letter to Orval.Similar to Orval, this is an ""Abbey Style Pale""- with virtually no tie to modern ""pale ale"" as we know it. The structure is far more English in its base. Brewed with aged hops and fermented in neutral oak, the fermentation profile of this beer is almost entirely driven by Brettanomyces Bruxellensis, famous for its fruity, funky characteristics of cherry pie, leather and barnyard, pastoral style funk.

Some folks come to conclusions, however, many do not. Whether we're conscious of it or not, we're all looking to define our purpose in this absurd universe.For a beer called What's The Point?, the brewing process was actually quite involved. It's an ode to one of our low-key favorite beers of all time, Taras Boulba, a Belgian-style session ale rarely found stateside (Hint: you may be able to find some at our brewery now, but you must act fast). Like Taras Boulba, What's the Point is a heavily noble-hopped beer with an expressive Belgian yeast strain. Hopping in the kettle with German Saaz & German Tettnanger lends sharp, verdant waves of citrus and resinous hop character. Fermentation with our house Belgian saison culture imparts a bone-dry finish, and finally, a light dry hop with a fruit-forward French hop (Aramis) yields a delicate, floral and sweet character. Decant this beer into a glass to enjoy the natural tiny bubbles resulting from can conditioning. As the beer releases carbonation and settles out over time, it unveils special aromas of spring flowers, mixed berries, fresh cut grass and hay."
Muses,New Orleans Lager & Ale Brewing Company (NOLA),"Louisiana, United States",Belgian Pale Ale,68,4.5,86,20389,3.79,9,16,0,3,"Mardi Gras in New Orleans is the stuff of deep tradition. Catch a random parade, and there’s a chance someone stood right where you’re standing, watching the same parade, when Grover Cleveland was in the White House. The Krewe of Muses isn’t one of the oldest, but it is without a doubt one of the best. The all-female krewe burst onto the scene in 2001 and promptly changed the game – big, boisterous and beautiful, with a new level of energy and artistry.It’s a crowd favorite across the city and definitely here at NOLA Brewing. So when it came time to make a Mardi Gras beer, who better to partner with than the ladies of Muses? Our Muses ale is offered during Carnival season with a portion of sales going to support the krewe’s philanthropy of choice. (In 2015, for example, it was Women With a Vision.)Mardi Gras is a celebration for the masses, so we brewed Muses to be a beer for the masses. A Belgian-style ale, light on the palate with low bitterness, select American hops providing a mild citrus edge to the traditional Belgian yeast flavor and aroma. Notably, Muses is a full-flavored session beer so it can be enjoyed all parade long, whether from the float or from the street.20 IBUs"

Triporteur From Heaven,BOMBrewery,Belgium,Belgian Pale Ale,41,6.2,86,19118,3.84,34,106,6,23,"A heavily hopped beer brewed using home-baked malt. Triporteur From Heaven is the modern version of traditional hopped ale. It is a heavenly beer brewed with home-baked BOM malt. The wheat malt in the unfiltered beer can produce a light cloudiness. The taste of Heaven remains evolving in the bottle. Heaven gets is distinctive hoppy aroma from the European aromatic hop varieties East Kent Golding and Styrian Golding, and from the American Cascade hop. Early hop: East Kent Golding, Styrian Golding. Late hop: East Kent Golding, Styrian Golding, Cascade. Dry hop: Cascade, Styrian Golding.The From Heaven was the first real Triporteur we brewed. Before this beer brewed an In Heaven, but this beer was only created as an try-out. The Hell was already developed when the from Heaven came on the market. This is shown by the devil who is already in the background of the label. He is running to show his beer to the baker. The recipe of this beer didn’t changed since the startup. We wanted to brew a modern version of a Belgian Blond beer. In Belgium we use the word blond for a beer what is light colored, it doesn’t matter what kind of style it really is. So it is blond, but the style? Did you know we are using an angel on the label when we use baked malt?"

Brewed with our 2-row malt blend, Maris Otter malt, and oats, the beer is then spiced with a subtle addition of coriander. We ferment it with our house yeast for classic Belgian citrus aromas. Hoppy Table Beer is hopped with Chinook, Cascade, Comet, and Azacca hops, then dry hopped with more Comet and Azacca. A mildly hoppy aroma full of grapefruit springs from this straw-colored, light-bodied ale. Flavors of pine and stone fruit balance the beer’s clean, slightly bitter finish."

The ageing process adds a fruity note, which strikes a subtle balance between the beer’s full-bodied yet complex flavour and bitterness.The beer was first brewed in 1931 and owes its unparalleled taste to the quality of the water, the hops and the yeast used. The brewery has selected very aromatic and unique hop varieties, which hark back to the first brewmaster of Orval, who hailed from Bavaria. The beer’s aromas are very pronounced while maintaining the right level of bitterness thanks to the English method of dry hopping.The various stages of fermentation – combined fermentation with the original yeast and with wild yeast, followed by fermentation in the bottle – mean the beer must age for some time and requires numerous quality controls."

Sunshine golden with a fluffy head and a veil of Belgian ale yeast, Singel’s tropical fruit esters complement its spicy hop aromatics. Delicate in body, Singel’s mellow, dry finish culminates a truly ethereal experience.Hardywood Singel's stylistic inspiration originates with the Trappist brewers of western Europe, who are often celebrated for their gloriously complex dubbels and tripels, and whose devotion to crafting heavenly libations is second to none. Unknown to many, some of the Trappist brewers also brew a milder ale for daily consumption within the walls of the monastery. Hardywood Singel is our interpretation of this style.30 IBU"

Our passion for Belgian Ales and European Lagers has always been central to what we do, but we finally found some time to reimagine what we can do and how we want to do it. Olyvia is the first of these beers to hit our packaging line. Our take on a true classic, Olyvia is simple but void of any cut corners. Its ingredient list is simple; the best Pale Ale malt Belgium has to offer, a light dusting of two of the most classic European noble hops ever, and our favorite Trappist yeast to produce notes of pear, apple, banana, cherry, plum, lemon, and hints of pepper and biscuit. While often playing second fiddle to the more popular Belgian Golden Strong Pale Ales, the simple Belgian Pale Ale is maybe one of the greatest styles of beer in history; popping off all of the same esters and flavors that Belgium made famous but more sessionable."

Good Sitter is specifically inspired by my experience sipping Cuvée de Jonquilles at Au Baron, a small brewery in France that just over the Belgian border.For me, beer is a way to capture a time, place, and feeling in a tangible, liquid form in order to share it with others. 'Good Sitter' is my attempt to bring the feeling of sipping a beautiful biere de garde at the source in Wallonia to you here in Chicago.We used raw spelt berries from our friends down at Janies mill, just south of the city and pilsner malt to create a simple base that also reflects the taste of Illinois. We hopped it with Bramling Cross, an English variety known for its aromas and flavors of lemon zest, black currant, fresh earth, black raspberry, and a slight pepperiness. Then we let our yeast work its magic. Fermented hot to stimulate ester production then cold conditioned for as long as it needed to refine the beautiful character out yeast provides. The result is a wonderfully simple, clean yet complex melding of pear, ripe banana, black raspberry, lemon rind, black peppercorn, plum, hearty country bread, and black currant with a full, soft body that leads to a lean, succinct finish."

This release is the first time the beer has been bottled, but it also differs from previous batches in that it's aged entirely in local vermouth barrels, lending a wonderful floral aroma while oak tannin and light fruit notes of rose and strawberry land on the palate.

To recreate this regional specialty, we imported all of the ingredients from the countries that birthed the style. The end result is a malt-forward amber with deep hints of caramel and candied apple. Eight different specialty malts come together to yield a magnificently complex malt profile. The French Strisselspalt hops used for aroma create a mildly spicy and floral bouquet. The unique yeast strain combined with warm fermentation and an extended cold-conditioning period produce a smooth and drinkable ale reminiscent of a lager but with full flavored ale fruitiness."

The Earth Is What We All Have In Common,Keeping Together,"Illinois, United States",Bière de Garde,Not Given,7.1,Not Given,Not Given,4.43,2,2,0,0,"The Earth is What We All Have in Common is a 7.1% ABV Bière de Garde made with Roasted Chestnuts, Dried Oranges, and Rosemary. Roasted chestnuts were added to the mash atop a bed of @sugarcreekmaltco Pilsner, Wheat, Rye, and Munich malts. The nose offers notes of honeyed wheat and toasted rye overlaid with bright aromas of tart cherry, blood orange, and overripe strawberry. Subtle hints of cinnamon, toasted nuts, and resinous poblano linger in the background. The beer presents with a bright lemony acidity in the front of the palate, and the flavor evolves from notes of zippy fresh citrus to dried apricot depth and finally into baked red apple richness. The bitterness is delicate and tea-like, the body is medium to medium-full with a soft and creamy carbonation. A quick and dry finish contributes to the beer's drinkability, making it a versatile and really lovely pairing companion for many different dishes.A note from KT Artist Jessica Deahl @jdeahl — ""This label was a lot of fun to draw. Moving in the general direction of “raw, organic, earth” I created an overgrowth of lichens and swirly earthy mushroom textures. It’s meant to be both dry and lush, a little world allowed to exist and flourish without human intervention."""

This ale is malty and rustic, with a spicy yeast character. Subtle flavors of French oak were derived from ageing in Rhône varietal Mourvèdre wine barrels over one year. This release is a special blend of vintages; the older barrels provide mild acidity and the yearling contributes the oak and rustic, bready malt character. The resulting blend is an excellent example of a truly French farmhouse-style cellar creation."

Reposé,Jester King Brewery,"Texas, United States",Bière de Garde,2,8.3,93,2918,4.21,27,231,33,54,"The inspiration for Reposé came from dusty, hay-filled barns like the one near Jester King where we store our aged hops. We attempted to capture some of our sensory experience of the barn by adding ingredients found in the attic to the beer. We added bales of hay to the mash and old hops that had spent many months in burlap bags to the boil. Further providing inspiration for Reposé was Bière de Garde, a traditional French farmhouse beer that likely originated out of the stone-walled barns that dot the landscape of northern France. Bière de Garde was historically brewed in fall and winter to take advantage of cooler fermentation temperatures, and aged for months before drinking. Similarly, Reposé was brewed during February of 2014 and slowly fermented for months prior to being blended and packaged in January of 2015. The wort for Reposé was brewed with Texas Hill Country water from our well, malted barley, hay, aged hops, and fresh hops. It was then pitched with Jester King’s unique mixed culture of brewer’s yeast and native yeast and bacteria harvested from the air and wildflowers around our brewery. After an initial fermentation in stainless steel, Reposé was then slowly fermented for months in Brandy barrels we received from France. It is 8.3% alcohol by volume, 12 IBU, has a finishing gravity of 1.004, and was 3.25 pH at the time of bottling. The label art is by Jester King’s Josh Cockrell."

In the same vein of our dark mild ale, Pubber, we bring you—Foggy Mountain. A 3.2% English-style Bitter (not actually that bitter) ale. A toasty earthy complex caramel experience. Layered deep with roasted malts (none too dark!). House pils malt, crystal 60, honey malt, malted oats, double roasted crystal, and a bit of complex farro wheat from Grain R&D. We bring this to a modest starting gravity. High range step mash. Boiled with a blend of noble hops. Knocked out at cool temps and fermented fast with our house English ale strain. A beautifully simple beer. Carbed on the low end to mimic cask ale, but recommend pouring hard to knock out even more CO2. Endlessly drinkable & communal. Pub ale for the people!"

With Tiny Montgomery, we wanted to explore the areas of sessionability that exist within the range of English styles. We're calling it a Small Pub Ale, a name befitting of the space the beer is named for. Our take on an Ordinary Bitter, it could be considered the lighter, crispier version of an English Mild. The beer is backed by expressive pale English malts, but the balance ultimately leans towards the hops for a lighter, moderately bitter mouthfeel and snappy floral finish. You'll be pleasantly surprised by the flavor and complexity packed into this small beer."

While they are English, they are not bitter at all! There are not alot of defining characteristics to Bitters, but balance and drinkability is the key to a good ESB. Our version of this classic style is malt forward, has a beautiful copper hue, and at 4.8% ABV is absolutely sessionnable!This beer is dedicated to the late John Cheesman (Mike's Poppa) who emigrated to Canada in 1957 from a suburb of London, England called 'Colliers Wood'. Colliers Wood took its name from a wood that stood to the east of Colliers Wood 'High Street'. High Street in England is similar to Main Street in Canada. Comically, the most famous landmark is the Colliers Wood Tower, which was voted the ugliest building in London by the BBC in 2006 (rude!). We decided to give it some love, and will be featuring this landmark on the side of High Street British Bitter cans :)"

Its malt bill shows more copper in color, and the caramel malts add a depth of maltiness that plays to the strength of our ESB type yeast which leaves the beer tasting full despite its very modest 4% alcohol. It is traditionally hopped with English Hops, Fuggle and East Kent Goldings which offer a herbal, woodsy, and grassy aromas. Our ""Best"" is a good example of a 'session' beer which is any type of beer that restrains its ABV and allows the drinker to enjoy a few brews in good company."

Our most popular beer, the one which made us famous, and the beer that has won numerous medals in a variety of awards. It has been in production for nearly 100 years and we still use the original recipeFor many ale drinkers, 6X is the only option, so if you’ve never tried it, don’t wait any longer. Full bodied and distinctive, it’s a strong premium ale with an ABV of 4.1% (4.3% in 500ml bottles and cans).Available by bottle, can, mini keg, cask or keg all year round, 6X is mid-brown in colour, malty and fruity on the nose with a balancing hoppy note. The delicious malt and fruit character emerge even more intensely on the palate with a long, lingering and malty finish.Did you know, 6X originally had an ABV of 6% but this was reduced to 4.3% and later to 4.1% in draught, due to the rationing of raw ingredients during WWII.6X was awarded a gold medal at the 2017 and 2018 World Beer Awards and has just won a gold medal for ‘Worlds Best Bitter Up To 4.5%’."

Pale Ale,The Schlafly Tap Room,"Missouri, United States",English Pale Ale,91,4.4,81,27235,3.59,263,555,14,153,"Our flagship Pale Ale is a smooth, balanced, copper-colored session beer with mildly spiced flavor and aroma from the East Kent Goldings hops. The bready, lightly caramel malt complements the hint of fruitiness contributed by the London Ale yeast, making it satisfying and authentic; the perfect flagship beer for Schlafly.Sixteenth century brewers created amber beers by using a form of coal called coke to roast their grains. Coke burns hotter and more steadily than wood without imparting the foul odors from coal. It allowed brewers to produce caramel malts that were paler alternatives to the common brown porters. At about the same time, Flemish migrants introduced hops to English beers and soon this ale became the chosen style of England from the mid-16th century until the end of the 20th century. Today, brewers outside England have adopted the Pale Ale and made it one of the leading styles of the American craft beer movement.25 IBU"

ESB is the strongest of the broader Bitter category, and incidentally, is a Fuller’s trademark in Great Britain, though the term has been co-opted by the North American craft movement to describe a maltier, bitter, dark red, mid-strength ale.

Brewed with Three Floyds all the way back in 2013, Tonnerre Neige (Thunder Snow) was our first commercial batch of beer and debuted during our preview pop-up Mischief at Black Rock Pub. Essentially it was a mixed fermented cross between a Belgian-style golden ale and a ""Super Saison."" So with this release as something of an homage, we pit Belgian saison yeast against French farmhouse ale yeast. And to echo the constant bickering between Belgium’s French and Flemish speaking regions, we let these two yeasts duke it out in a grisette wort that creates complex notes of black pepper phenols, mild fruit and bubblegum with a dry and spritzy finish. And yes, clocking in at 6% puts this a little higher than the traditional grisettes enjoyed by miners over the last 200+ years, but we think you'll find it no less refreshing."

A lengthy conditioning on Brazilian Amburana wood adds otherworldly vanilla and gingerbread layers to this highly drinkable yet full bodied treat.

Holding it up to the light, deep ruby highlights emerge, revealing the origins of its name. This is a smooth, malt-focused beer that's almost too easy to drink.

Crack open The Craic and let the friendly banter, bursts of laughter, and toe-tapping music of the season get your eyes smiling.This hybrid ale combines two classic styles —IPA and Irish Red Ale—to create a unique and flavorful beer. Th­e malt combination commonly used in Irish Red Ales brings a toasted, malty flavor that balances the citrusy and fruity character of the hops.The Levels of Craic: Have you tried our new Irish Red IPA, The Craic? As we prepare for all things Irish for Harpoon St. Pat’s Fest on March 3rd and 4th, we thought it would only be right to give you a little bit more history about the phrase ‘the craic.’ Pronounced just like a drug, crack (crack is whack, btw!), it’s a term for news, gossip, fun, entertainment, and enjoyable conversation. You’ll often hear, “What’s the Craic” in Ireland which is like saying “What’s Happening?” But perhaps our favorite part of the word ‘craic’ is that there are actually 6 levels of craic you can reach (according to IrelandCentral. Check ‘em out: Level One: Good Craic – It’s an okay night out, but nothing to write home about (we don’t know why we mentioned this because honestly, St. Pat’s Fest could never be just at level one – but … the more you know). Level Two: Mighty Craic – It’s obviously a little bit better than good craic, but we still haven’t hit the amazing level. One or two of your friends may have done something a little bit crazy. Hopefully, you caught it on Snapchat.Level Three: Savage Craic – This is getting closer to how we describe St. Pat’s. A great time with your friends; beers flowing, great bands, food, and jokes. You got a number, you gave a number, you get the idea. Level Four: Deadly Craic –This is most likely just before you hear Shipping Up to Boston by the Dropkick Murphy’s (right?). It’s just a step about savage, but not quite the pinnacle moment. Level Five: The craic was ninety – Wait, what? We’ve read that this phrase comes from a famous song by The Dubliners (get your Irish jig on), but essentially it’s the best night ever. Which is what we hope you’ll leave St. Pat’s fest saying. Level Six: Minus Craic – When a night goes terribly wrong. As employee owners, we’ve seen several of our consumers (and friends, to be honest), hit this level. Don’t be that guy! So, now that you know – what level of craic are you looking for this St. Pat’s Fest?!"

So our Bia Hoi is really only a “lager” in name only. It features a heavy serving of flaked rice, uses Saaz hops and ginger in the kettle, and is fermented in about 7 days with lager yeast. It’s then naturally carbonated and treated with thai basil before moving to kegs. The finished beer is super light with a bright finish and huge hit of basil on the nose."

The water combines with selected barley malt and maize (corn) before adding Hallertau Magnum hops.The addition of maize gives a lightness to the beer both in terms of color and taste and also adds a hint of sweetness, which balances the bitterness from the Hallertau hops. The combination of these ingredients brewed by the master brewer to a recipe basically unchanged since 1846 gives a beer with balanced bitterness, a floral fruity nose and a delicate pale-golden color.This lager, like all of the Menabrea beers is matured peacefully in their underground cellars for 6 weeks. This beer has been matured in the brewery’s deep, cold cellars the same way for over 170 years."

Fermented cool with our preferred lager yeast strain until bone dry and lagered cold until crisp and crushable.Employing some incredibly technical brewing skills, this is the first in the series highlighted by a decoction mash. An old world practice, the process involves removing a portion of the main mash and bringing it up to a boil. Going through a series of steps, this process is said to provide a depth to the finished beer, not possible otherwise. In addition, a technique known as spunding, we closed off ICE during fermentation in order to capture all of the CO2 being expelled and trapping it into solution. The result yields an unparalleled crisp lager beer with tiny dancing bubbles which form a frothy rocky head. Total production time of six weeks.As the cold temperatures of winter settle in, we know that an alcohol boost in a crushable light lager is just the thing to provide some much needed warmth. With the same crushability as the other lagers in this series, we are certain this is a beer that any ICE fishing grandpa would have slugged. Best paired with warm carhartt gloves, falling snowflakes, ICE fishing or immediately following a polar plunge into beautiful Lake James."

It was first brewed in 1900 when three Germans opened a brewery, the Cerveceria del Pacífico in Mazatlán. Cerveza Pacifico is named so because the Pacifico brewery is located in the Pacific Ocean port city of Mazatlán, in the state of Sinaloa, México. Its label includes a picture depicting a lifesaver encompassing a hill with the port's lighthouse, known locally as ""Cerro del Crestón."" In Mazatlán, the beer is available in three different size bottles: ""cuartitos"" (6 fl. oz), ""medias"" (12 fl. oz.), and ""ballenas"" (32 fl. oz.).

It’s heritage and popularity are proudly displayed throughout Wisconsin and Illinois — one can’t go far without seeing a historically protected Old Style sign hanging on the side of a barn or in a tavern window.Old Style first crossed state lines into Illinois to capitalize nationwide bottlers strike and subsequent product rationing by the competition. It wasn’t long before Old Style became Chicago’s beer – served from the North Side to the South Side and everywhere in between. Being accepted as a true local, Old Style began sponsoring the Chicago Cubs in 1950. With Old Style still being served at Wrigley Field today, the partnership is one of longest standing in the country.In 2009, Old Style revived the centuries-old German brewing tradition called “Kraeusening.” This double fermentation process increases carbonation and richness, ultimately leading to a better tasting beer that has since been won medals at the Great American Beer Festival and World Beer Cup."

But if there’s one thing we’ve learned in this time, it’s that there is so much more to learn. In the spirit of trying new things, learning new things and building a community of lager lovers, we teamed up with Bierstadt from Denver for this collaboration. Bierstadt has been equally committed to the craft of perfected lagers since their founding in 2016 and we are clearly cut from the same grain.Together, we brewed a Munich Style Export Lager. This beer features a double decoction mash, that is then fermented in a traditional horizontal tank for 8 weeks, and krausened with a special yeast. We look forward to raising this one with our best lager friends."

VR Pizza Boi,DSSOLVR,"North Carolina, United States",European / Dortmunder Export Lager,Not Given,5.1,Not Given,Not Given,4.03,1,0,0,0,"When Riverbend Malt does a cool malt swap with Skagit Valley Malting, you order that Talisman malt REAL FRIGGIN’ QUICK. These two craft maltsters did a base malt swap, and then malted grains from each others’ respective areas (rather than focusing on their own local malt), so this was the perfect opportunity to do some fun experimentation with terroir. Thus, “VR Pizza Boi” was born.With this in mind, we changed up the plan and brewed a style we’ve been keeping in our pocket for something a little more fun: DORTMUNDER EXPORT LAGER. Yeah, that’s right… the style EVERYONE has just constantly been asking for. Essentially, this style is similar to a Pilsner, but less bitter, and similar to a Helles, but more malt-forward, and with a much harder water profile than either of those. Subtle bitterness, pronounced malt, high minerality. Hell yeah.Notes of fresh baguettes in the morning, a hint of fruit akin to sucking on a Peach noyaux, licking a real nice granite countertop, and a lovely Honeysuckle bouquet. This probably goes well with pizza. Just sayin’."

This year we teamed up with Beachwood Brewing of Long Beach, California to brew this classic dortmunder style lager using all American ingredients including Liberty Hops from the Pacific Northwest & Idaho grown malted barley from Great Western Malting Co. & releasing it on the 505th anniversary of Reinheitsgebot, bringing glory back to the American made lager.

As more and more quality Marzens show up at Autumn-fests around NJ, we decided that the drift off the beaten craft opportunity here was to make the “drinking beer of the fest"" as traditionally as possible. A floor-malted German-pils malt bill picks up a Festbier touch of autumnal richness through the addition of light Munich and Victory. Then hop spiciness comes in the form of Tettnanger and Strisselspalt for both the kettle and late-hop additions. Drink Festy because these days a commitment to tradition is as far off the path's trend as can be."

As such, this festbier is brewed as a fuller-bodied helles lager with a slightly louder presence of old world hops instead of a marzen and is available to festivals year-round!"

A Wondrous take on an Oktoberfest style lager. Paying respect to the Märzens that were originally poured at the celebration and adding a modern touch by crafting a slightly more pale and lighter bodied beer. This recipe is a conceptive blend of the OG Bavarian fest beers and the modern, more drinkable style beer that is poured today. Multi Step mash in the sudhaus, fermented with our house Bavarian lager yeast, naturally spunded and lagered sideways for many moons. Thick creamy foam, beautiful bready biscuit aromas, soft luscious grain character, smooth mouthfeel and balanced hop bitterness and flavor, we are uber happy with this beer."

It’s dark, it’s bright, it’s a Helles disguised as a Vienna lager. We think there’s one way to find out - go to Munich, brave the drunken hordes and general fleecing, and you will find out that what we put in this can is what Munich’s legendary breweries pour into your overpriced stein. A deep golden lager that proudly displays it’s hefty grain bill with a robust body and a fine balance of spice, hints of floral notes and a gentle bitter. A Festbier is a fine, strong lager that does not deserve the brouhaha people make around its target destination, the Oktoberfest. Especially when we can save you a trip to Germany with this truly authentic version in stock at your craft shop."

We do, however believe there is room for a beer that is similar to an IPA, but is one that allows the hop characters to shine through as only a lager can do... ""An IPA done better"", if you will. To get this clean, crisp character, we brewed an ""IPA style"" beer, using lager yeast. The lager yeast is superior, in this case, because it doesn’t create all of the fruity esters and fusel alcohols that ale yeast create... so it allows the delicate hop oils to shine through in the beer. Our IPL takes longer to brew and is more expensive to make than an IPA, but once you try this IPL, we think you’ll agree........ It’s worth the extra time and expense."

Not only is there less SO2 (Sulfur Dioxide) pick up during a warmer fermentation, but the lager yeast allows the hops to shine without competing ale yeast strain esters. The result is a perfect balance of hops and drinkability. Our Cold Boi was created with the thought of combating the warm summer months in our hometowns. Together we used a blend of hand-selected Citra, Mosaic, Simcoe, and HBC-586 hops from our 2021 crop selections with Yakima Chief. At 6.5% this crispy, light-bodied, and hoppy IPA will have you thinking about Cold Boi Summer for all your upcoming adventures!"

Our goal with this beer was to create a lager that blurred the lines between styles. Our research began by selecting hops that were the offspring of one of our favorite German hop varietals: Hallterau Mittelfruh. As we learned more about the New Zealand Wai-iti hop, we began to grow fond of its more delicate qualities. In a world of juice bombs, Wai-iti was softer and more reminiscent of its noble hop parent, while still providing pungent aromas of citrus and stone fruit.After selecting the hop combination, we knew we wanted to preserve our multi-step mashing regimen in order to balance the beer. Employing a five step mashing process brought out some of the deep biscuit and honey flavors that would serve as the base for the fruity and floral hops.As with all of our lagers, we kept this beer cold throughout fermentation and maturation to ensure a smooth mouthfeel and finish. This year, we dry hopped it and cold extracted the hops over an extended period of time to contribute a bigger aroma.Modern lagers have so much potential, and we’re very proud of where we’ve brought this beer. Come trick your palate into thinking it is your favorite hop forward ale on the front end, and then reassure it with the smooth lager finish.40 IBU"

A Cold IPA is an emerging style that aims to achieve a crispier IPA. Even though it’s called an India Pale Ale, it’s actually a (hopped up) lager, because it’s been fermented with lager yeast. The base beer is an American adjunct lager using corn, which was matured in tank at just above the freezing point. To give it those IPA vibes, we generously dry-hopped with Idaho 7, Simcoe and Hallertau Blanc.The result is a bright, hop-forward, clean and crisp beer that’ll have you ready for patio season. You’ll pick up aromas of dank, resinous pine, bright citrus and herbs, with flavours of peach, mango, ripe orange and grapefruit rind. Cold Call clocks in at 6.8% ABV, but you’d never know it. It’s sneaky, crispy and smooth and we think you’re all gonna love it!"

By using a lighter malt base, a blend of pilsner and 2-row, and a squeaky clean German Lager yeast, this allows Nelson to show off, and rightfully so. Exploding with white wine fruitiness and gooseberry, we recruited the assistance of Wakatu and Dr. Rudi to balance the hop profile. This beer is a spotlight on New Zealand and we hope you grow just as fond of the Southern Hemisphere as we have."

It is high in alcohol and is extremely bitter. It has a powerful citrus and passion fruit aroma that comes from the reckless amount of exotic hops that we dumped into the fermentation tank. Although the inspiration for this beer was the West Coast Imperial IPA, we couldn’t help ourselves from putting our own spin on this style. Instead of adding sugar to the boil kettle to help dry out the beer’s finish, we used a hearty dose of whole kernel corn from our farm. Instead of using the typical American Ale yeast strain, we used our house German Lager yeast. If you don’t love hops, you’ll hate this beer. But, if you are a confirmed hop-head, we think you’ll really enjoy our take on this modern American classic.IBU: ~100Grain: 2 Row, Champaign County Corn, CaraHell, C20Boil Hops: Chinook, CascadeDry Hops: Citra, Amarillo, Cascade"

To make this heady beverage, we paired the palest malt we could find with some rice and gave it a whopping 6 IBUs. Then, we fermented it low and slow with our favorite German lager yeast to yield the best dang boring lager we could make. But oh boy, things took a turn for party town once we added a gigantic dose of Mosaic and Mosaic Cryo dry hops! The resulting liquid offers a pungent expression of tangerine, lemon, ripe tropical fruit, gooseberries, juicy hop resins, and blueberries that leap from your glass.

We first laid a foundation of Vienna and Pilsen malt, and then co-fermented it with our house lager yeast and a lactic acid producing strain of yeast. We followed our typical lagering process for this beer and then extensively dry-hopped it with Idaho 7 and Ekuanot. The resulting IPL is crisp and clean, with dank hops on the nose accompanied by passion fruit on the palate and a very slight lactic presence on the back-end. It is not a sour ipa, but more of an exploration of what subtle levels of acidification can add to the overall composition of a beer, and we couldn't be happier with the results."

Schäfer said that the variety has nearly disappeared—only one hectare grew last year—but he wanted its spicy character. It’s not a flashy beer meant for sipping and sampling; just a tasty one that will reward repeat drinking."

During my time helping 5 Stones transition into their new brewery, I've proclaimed the merits of Pilsner beers; their historical relevance, the difficulty of their construction and execution, and ultimately their drinkability. After much deliberation, discussion, and help from many friends we brewed a German-style Keller Pils of our own, utilizing two vacant horizontal fermentation vessels intended for the production of fruit beer in the warmer months. Keller Pils, or unfiltered Pilsner, deviates a bit from the idea many conjure up when thinking of Pilsner. Being unfiltered, it still contains some yeast leftover from fermentation. It is somewhat cloudy, textured, and softer in the presence of it's yeast. Furthermore, it presents more fermentation character than its filtered counterparts. In this beer, one may find aromas and flavors of biscuit dough, bitter greens, fresh cut hay, sulphur, tarragon and chamomile. Some of those descriptors may seem strange, or unwelcome in a glass of beer, but in this case the whole is truly greater than the sum of it's parts. And the beauty of these types of beers is that one can simply drink it. It doesn't require thinking, pondering, or analysis, though one can certainly consider the nuances if they so please!"

Zwickelbier comes from the Franconia region in Germany and dates back beyond the Middle Ages. The name “Zwickelbier” stems from the sampling mug (”Zwickel” in German) mounted at the outside of the tank for assessing the brew’s progress during fermentation. The Zwickelbier style is an unfiltered lager beer (Bottom-fermenting) that traditionally is served as soon as fermentation is complete.Kuebelbier is brewed as a pilsner and is then bottled directly from the cellars without any filtration allowing all the yeast and natural substances to enter the bottle. Unlike Kellerbier, the maturation casks of Zwickelbier are bunged (”gespundet"" in German) just before the end of the fermentation. This builds up effervescence in the brew. Our Kuebelbier is a very unique interpretation of this classic style to add robustness & character. It is quite hoppy at around 35 IBU. The beer pours a cloudy orange-yellowish color with a nice white head. The unqiue attributes of the style come through on the palate as the flavors imparted by the yeast compliment the hop character and carbonation in the beer to create a unqiuely robust yet refreshing beer."
