# Welcome to My Vivino
***

## Task
My Vivino is an online marketplace. We have a vast wine database, and we have 27 million users, mainly in North America.

One of our leading services is a wine recommendation system. It starts to be a little old. Rules-based. We are selling wine based on our customer visit/research.

You've just finished a meeting with your product manager. Data science is the future, and our competitor my_wine.com has invested a lot in it.

Following your suggestion, my_vivino's CEO has decided to allocate a budget to move forward on the data science project you've proposed.

Which project?

What are the success criteria?

During our next meeting, you will have to show us some data (plot? report?) of what you've been building.
Impact on the business. We need to make our customers happy.
